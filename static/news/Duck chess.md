In response to recent popularity of Duck chess we've decided to add it to pychess as well. If you're not familiar with the game
here's a nice introductory video by <a href="/@/EricRosen">Eric Rosen</a>

Also we've added Duck chess to our tournament schedule on the 27th of each month, the introductory arena will happen on 27 Dec 2022, 16:00 UTC, we'll be more than happy if you join

Also special thanks to <a href="/@/ubdip">@ubdip</a> for adding the duck rule to Fairy-Stockfish

Also Happy New year!

Also quack ðŸ¦†
